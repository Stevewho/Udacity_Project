## Project Developing

I apply 2 version of DDPG, one is from Udacity, and the other is at the following GitHub

https://gist.github.com/ctmakro/2e0017f25b06177af539dd410b946428


For the Udacity code, it is easy to understand the flow, but it would not give me the good result. On the other hand, ctmakro's code gives me a good result.

I try to debug or find out the problem of apply Udacity code, and I apply gym, 'Pendulum-v0', with Udacity code to see what I can do. But turn out there is no a proper result.

Welcome to try the code I build for this project.
